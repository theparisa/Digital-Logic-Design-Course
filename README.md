# Digital-Logic-Design-Course

This course covers the foundational principles of digital logic, which form the building blocks of modern computers and digital systems. It explores how to design and analyze both **combinational circuits**, whose outputs depend only on current inputs, and **sequential circuits**, which have memory. The lessons build from basic transistor logic up to designing complex systems using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) like Verilog.

## Key Concepts Covered
* **_Number Representation_**
* **_Transistor Switches, CMOS Structures_**
* **_Complex Gates and Boolean Algebra_**
* **_Hazards and Multiplexers_**
* **_Decoders and Multiplexers_**
* **_RTL Combinational Components_**
* **_Flip-flops, Functional Registers_**
* **_Verilog description and state machines_**
